# selective_web_scraper
Chrome extension for scraping highlighted text. Currently expected behaviour: pop-up text message with highlighted text after highlighting text and clicking the `+` button. To install go to `chrome://extensions`, switch on `Developer mode`, select `Load unpacked` and find, and select the root directory of the extension.
